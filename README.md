  The escalation of fraudulent activities in recent years, due to technological advancements in payments and financial transactions, has emerged as a substantial concern. This form of fraud has evolved into a global issue, resulting in annual losses amounting to billions of dollars, as it was 48 billion dollars in 2023. The implications extend to individuals and businesses alike, as financial institutions face potential challenges related to trust and loyalty. In response to this escalating threat, organizations have increasingly embraced machine learning as an immediate response. Leveraging this form of artificial intelligence facilitates the processing of extensive datasets, employing specialized algorithms to discern patterns and anomalies. Notably, the capability to identify fraudulent behavior in real-time has become feasible with the analysis of dynamic, non-static data.
   
   In this assessment, we aim to introduce the business proposal of a Financial Manager Application called CH Banking Solutions which is targeted to business owners or financial departments to better manage their financial transactions as well as those with suspicious traits that could be considered as fraudulent based on customer behaviour and machine learning technologies. This financial tool will be further discussed in the following sections along with its implications and expanding features ideas to be assessed for implementation in order to make our product stand out from already existing ones in the financial market.
